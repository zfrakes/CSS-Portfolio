<h2>About Me</h2>

 <p><img src="images/Zoey.jpg" style="width:250px;height:250px;margin-right:15px;"></img>
     Hello friends, My name is Zoey Frakes. I was born and raised in West Philadelphia. 
    I graduated from  Pennsylvania State University, where I received a bachelor of science degree in Health Policy Administration. 
    Although I lived in Philadelphia for most of my life, I spent a year living in Washington D.C., after graduating from college. 
    Iâ€™ve traveled a few other places but never really lived anywhere else. One of my goals in life is to travel to every continent. I  want to visit every state in the United States. 
    When I am not planning on how to travel the world; I enjoy attending plays/ musicals, watching movies, arts, and crafts, and spending time with family and friends.
